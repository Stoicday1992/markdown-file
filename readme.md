**Questions 1**
      
  1. Markup languages are generally used in a document as instructions on how a document will appear. the most common language used is HTML(Hypertext markup language).

  2. HTML is used mainly in creating webpages, it enables structures when designing a page, it is the framework

  3. The HTML markup will always start with a start tag < and then end with an end tag >. Anything that is placed within these 2 symbols is considered an element. main tages are head body and html.

  4. appears that most markup languages are similar. you can tell a markup language by the last 2 characters in the abbreviation ML(markup language). Other languages include SGML, XML XHTML

  5. SGML was the original and all the others are branches of that language. XML is a language that can be modified as it is used and is not as rigid as the others. HTML is the easiest to use but also very simple. (https://port.sas.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=568&chapterid=336)
